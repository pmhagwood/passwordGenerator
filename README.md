# Password Generator
## An HTML page to create passwords based on user input

This directory contains an html file, js file, and style sheet. The magic happens inside the JS. It contains the code to generate a password between 8 and 128 characters. The user will select if they want the password to include uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, or special characters.
